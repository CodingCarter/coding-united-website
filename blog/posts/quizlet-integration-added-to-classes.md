Hello, everyone, in this article we will be explaining our latest feature that allows you to study our custom Quizlets within our classes.  We hope to smoothly integrate these Quizlets into each of our classes to make our site more interactive to help studying.  Here is an example of one of our Quizlets from [our course on JSON, the data language](/classes/intro-to-json/), below:
